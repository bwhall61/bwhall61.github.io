            My name is Brendan Hall and I'm a fifth year PhD student in the Biophysics
            program at UCSF in the lab of Brian Shoichet (and previously Mike Keiser).
            In April I'll be starting as a scientist at <a href=https://montaratx.com/>Montara Therapeutics</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I went to Williams College where I got degrees in Physics and Math and modeled
            the kinetics of translation elongation and codon dependent ribosomal stalling
            with Daniel Aalberts.
        </p>
        <p>
            At UCSF I work in structure based drug discovery and develop methods to more 
            efficiently traverse chemical space with molecular docking.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time I enjoy playing pickup volleyball and exploring the bars
            and restaurants in San Francisco.

            At a high level I'm interested in cheminformatic and machine learning
            approaches to drug discovery with an emphasis on virtual screening and molecular docking. 
          <p>
            While most of my research has focused on improving how we sample molecules from chemical space (Retrieval Augmented Docking),
            I have a longer-term interest in combining these advancements with improved scoring functions.
            While virtual screening still relies heavily on physics-based scoring,
            I believe the growing wealth of biophysical data will enable models that  
            more accurately and quickly predict binding affinity.
            Combined with improved chemical space sampling, these models will  enable 
            the rapid and accurate screening of chemical libraries of tens of billions of molecules
            and beyond.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am also interested in moving beyond affinity prediction to study how computational methods
            can better predict ligand bias, cell and blood-brain barrier permeability, and broader ADME properties, 
            and how these predictions can be more effectively integrated into 
            virtual screening workflows.

            Molecular docking is a method to computationally predict how molecules
            bind to proteins. Docking the tens to hundreds
            of billions of commercially available molecules takes significant computational
            resources and considerable time. We found that organizing chemical
            libraries into Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs
            allows us to recover a majority of the best molecules while docking only a fraction of the total library. 
            We demonstrated this method retrospectively, screening a library of 100 million molecules
            against 2 receptors with 2 different scoring functions.

            While molecular docking campaigns of hundreds of millions to billions of molecules are performed, the results are rarely shared in full.
            We developed a website providing access to poses, scores, and <i>in vitro</i> results for molecular docking campaigns against 
            11 targets, with 6.3 billion molecules docked and 3729 compounds experimentally tested.
            We used the new database to train machine learning models to predict docking scores and combined these models with
            my chemical space exploration method, Retrieval Augmented Docking.

            While deep learning co-folding methods (Alphafold3, Boltz-2, Chai-1) can help address the challenges 
            of predicting ligand-bound protein complexes and ranking them, their evaluation has been hampered by data leakage and insufficiently
            large test sets. We tested the ability of co-folding methods to predict the structures of 557 ligands bound to the SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain.
            We also assessed whether co-folding methods could rescore molecular docking hit-lists to distinguish true ligands
            from non-binders among hundreds of molecules tested against AmpC β-lactamase, and the dopamine D4 and the σ2 receptors.

        <p class='project-title'> Ribosome Profiling Data </p>
            Ribosome profiling is a method to identify ribosome pause sites within the transcriptome.
            In E. Coli, the method requires an enzyme that demonstrates significant sequence
            bias during RNA cleavage, hampering the ability to precisely determine the position of
            ribosomes. We used 3' count assignment, pooling, and a debiasing method to more accurately
            predict the location of ribosomes. We used this improved data to show that relative codon stalling rates
            are not strongly correlated with relative tRNA concentrations as frequently suggested.

        <p class='project-title'> This Website </p>
        <p>
            One day I saw that Google was offering .phd domains and figured it was a sign
            to make my own website (instead of a linkedin). 
            I wanted something interactive that showcased my interests in small molecule drug discovery. 
            I saw a cool project called 3Dmol.js which provided nice molecular visualizations and after 
            modifying it slightly, this is what I ended up with.
            Hope you like it :)

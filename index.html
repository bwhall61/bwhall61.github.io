            My name is Brendan Hall and I'm a fifth year PhD student in the Biophysics
            program at UCSF in the lab of Brian Shoichet (and previously Mike Keiser).
            In April I'll be starting as a scientist at <a href=https://montaratx.com/>Montara Therapeutics</a>.

            I went to Williams College where I got degrees in Physics and Math and modeled
            the kinetics of translation elongation and codon dependent ribosomal stalling
            with Daniel Aalberts.
        </p>

            At UCSF I work in structure based drug discovery and devleop methods to more 
            efficeintly traverse chemical space with molecular docking.

            In my free time I enjoy playing pickup volleyball and exploring the bars
            and restaurants in San Francisco.

            At a high level I'm interested in how cheminformatic and machine learning
            approaches can be applied to aid in the field of drug discovery with an emphasis
            on virtual screening and molecular docking. As with most computational biophysics, virtual
            screening comes down to two things:
          <p>
          <p>
            1) Sampling, or how we pick molecules from the vast universe of chemical space to evaluate
          </p>
          <p>
            2) Scoring, or how we evaluate these molecules for their desirable properties (binding affinity,
            ADMET properties, etc...)
          </p>
          <p>
            While most of my research so far has focused on how we sample molecules from chemical space (RAD)
            I have a longer term interest in combining these improved sampling methods with improved scoring functions.
            We still rely heavily on physics based scoring functions,
            but I believe the current wealth of biophysical data will ultimately allow us to
            train models that are able to more accurately and quickly predict binding affinity.
            In combination with improved chemical space sampling, this will enable the
            rapid and accurate screening of chemical libraries of tens of billions of molecules
            and beyond.

            Molecular docking is a method that computationally predicts how well molecules
            bind to proteins as a way to screen for potential drugs. Docking the tens to hundreds
            of billions of commercially available molecules takes significant computational
            resources and considerable time. We found that pre-organizing chemical
            libraries into hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) graphs
            allows us to find a majority of the best molecules while docking only a fraction of the total library,
            saving significant time, and allowing us to explore many more chemotypes. We retrospectively
            demonstrated this method for screening 100 million molecules
            against 2 receptors with 2 different scoring functions.

            As part of a UCSF donor outreach event, I created an
            interactive drug design experience to highlight how ML is being used in
            drug discovery. Participants were split into groups and worked
            to build physical molecular models which were then scanned via webcam to a computer where their
            molecules could be docked, scored, and explored in virtual reality. All the while, they competed
            against ML models which were doing high throughput virtual screening and small molecule diffusion. A central
            leaderboard visualized the diffusion process, highlighted the speed at which ML methods explore
            chemical space compared to humans, and showed the best scoring molecules discovered by each group and the
            different ML methods.

        <p class='project-title'> Ribosome Profiling Data </p>
            Ribosome profiling is a method to identify the ribosome pause sites within the transcriptome.
            Performing this technique in E. Coli requires an enzyme that demonstrates significant sequence
            bias during RNA cleavage. This hampers our ability to precisely determine the position of the
            ribosomes. We use 3' count assignment, pooling, and a debiasing method to more accurately
            predict the location of ribosomes. We use this improved data to calculate relative codon stalling rates
            and find that they are not strongly correlated with relative tRNA concentrations.

        <p class='project-title'> This Website </p>
        <p>
            One day I saw that Google was offering .phd domains and figured that was a sign
            to make my own website. Rather than make a typical informational website, I wanted something
            interactive that showcased my interests in small molecule drug discovery. I saw a super cool
            project called 3Dmol.js which provided really slick molecular visualizations and knew that
            I wanted to build my site using it. After modifying it slightly, this is what I ended up with!
            Hope you like it :)
